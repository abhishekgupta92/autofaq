IBM's statistical question answering system
Treatment of the problem as an information retrieval (given the fact that they have large database to search over like a typical information retrieval problem).
Their system is not really answering the question, but in a way fetching the nearest possible statements.
To find the correlation they use the techniques like - Matching Words, Thesauras Match, Mis-Match Words, Dispersion, and Cluster Words.

Question Answering from Frequently Asked Question Files: Experiences with the FAQ FINDER System
This paper is about FAQ FINDER, a natural language question-answering system that uses files of frequently asked questions as its knowledge base. Unlike information-retrieval approaches that rely on a purely lexical metric of similarity between query and document, it uses a semantic knowledge base (WORDNET) to improve its ability to match question and answer.
Since, no such semantic knowledge base yet exists (in a usable form) for Bangla, as I suggested we should work in an domain independent fashion initially, and implement the things in  a way so that tools like above can be hot plugged without any issue.

Automated faq answering: Continued experience with shallow language understanding
Does not analyze user queries; instead, analysis is applied to FAQs the in database long before any user queries are submitted.
Work of FAQ retrieval is reduced to keyword matching without inferring; the system still creates an illusion of intelligence.
Some more work to order to process phrases
The approach can be very much adopted for the step 1 of the project

Automated Question Answering Using Question Templates That Cover the Conceptual Model of the Database
Would help while working on step 5. The paper describes where during the question-answering process, the system retrieves relevant data instances and question templates, and offers one or several interpretations of the original question. The user selects an interpretation to be answered.
